Online Saloon Booking System using HTML , CSS and ASP.NET

My project entitled as “Online Salon and Spa Booking System”. Salon
and Spa is a Website developed for a Salon and Spa in order to book appointments, pay, get
feedback from Customers. This System is provided with proper registration form with date
and time slot and types of services the user needs.

This system helps the Salon and Spa to overcome the difficulty of managing
their customers and to boost up their business through online booking as well as, Customers
to book their appointment by their desired date, time slot and types of services which they
can pay early through online or by cash.
The home page contains various links to proceed like men booking, women
booking, Admin, and Feedback to report for improvements or a message for Salon.
Both men and women modules have common features like to choose the
desired type of services as they need and provide feedback.

This package is developed in Windows platform. The programming Language
used is ASP.NET ,HTML\CSS and  SQL Server is used as an backend database for details.

I have attached my project's documentation in this repository.
